Preparation.
    Unzip            java-lab-exercise-tests-*.zip
    Change dir to    lab04-05 (change the lab number as needed)
    In there, unzip  junit6-checkthat-demo.zip

    Make sure that you are using Java 25+: run  java --version  and  javac --version

Details by system.
    Linux and Mac: run once     : chmod +x check.cmd
    Mac:           run once     : xattr -d com.apple.quarantine check.cmd
    Windows cmd (not PowerShell): leave out "./" in the commands below

You may use check.cmd to compile and run structural/functional/suite tests.
You'll find the exact javac and java commands being run in its printout.

    ./check.cmd TimeStructureTest.java TimeStructureTest
    ./check.cmd time/TimeTest.java     time.TimeTest
    ./check.cmd TimeTestSuite.java     TimeTestSuite

Structural test files and test suite files are always given to you.
For details about how to create your own functional tests, see time/TimeTest.java
Note that your code is not compiled by the above when working with structural tests.

Here is the expected output of the full suite.
The failures are intentional. See the comments in Time.java for the trivial fixes.

Failures (6):
    <some details omitted>
[5/8 tests successful] [3/8 tests failed]

After applying the trivial fixes in Time.java, the final printout changes to:
[All 11 tests successful]
